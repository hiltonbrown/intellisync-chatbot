    "description": "Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct is an instruction-tuned chat model in the Qwen3-Next series optimized for fast, stable responses without “thinking” traces. It targets complex tasks across reasoning, code generation, knowledge QA, and multilingual use, while remaining robust on alignment and formatting. Compared with prior Qwen3 instruct variants, it focuses on higher throughput and stability on ultra-long inputs and multi-turn dialogues, making it well-suited for RAG, tool use, and agentic workflows that require consistent final answers rather than visible chain-of-thought.\n\nThe model employs scaling-efficient training and decoding to improve parameter efficiency and inference speed, and has been validated on a broad set of public benchmarks where it reaches or approaches larger Qwen3 systems in several categories while outperforming earlier mid-sized baselines. It is best used as a general assistant, code helper, and long-context task solver in production settings where deterministic, instruction-following outputs are preferred."

    "description": "Llama Guard 4 is a Llama 4 Scout-derived multimodal pretrained model, fine-tuned for content safety classification. Similar to previous versions, it can be used to classify content in both LLM inputs (prompt classification) and in LLM responses (response classification). It acts as an LLM—generating text in its output that indicates whether a given prompt or response is safe or unsafe, and if unsafe, it also lists the content categories violated.\n\nLlama Guard 4 was aligned to safeguard against the standardized MLCommons hazards taxonomy and designed to support multimodal Llama 4 capabilities. Specifically, it combines features from previous Llama Guard models, providing content moderation for English and multiple supported languages, along with enhanced capabilities to handle mixed text-and-image prompts, including multiple images. Additionally, Llama Guard 4 is integrated into the Llama Moderations API, extending robust safety classification to text and images."
