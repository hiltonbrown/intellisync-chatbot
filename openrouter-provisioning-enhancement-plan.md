# OpenRouter Individual API Key Provisioning - Enhancement Plan

## Current State Analysis
The codebase already has a comprehensive individual API key provisioning system implemented in `lib/services/openrouter-keys.ts` with:
- Complete API key lifecycle management (create, rotate, delete)
- AES-256-GCM encryption for secure key storage
- Credit limit enforcement and usage tracking
- Audit logging for all key operations
- Integration with Clerk user metadata
- Webhook-based automatic provisioning

## Enhancement Areas

### 1. API Integration Improvements
- **Update chat API** (`app/api/chat/route.ts`) to prioritize user-specific keys over shared keys
- **Enhance error handling** for key validation and usage limit checks
- **Add fallback mechanisms** when user keys are exhausted or invalid

### 2. User Experience Enhancements
- **Create key management UI** for users to view their key status, usage, and limits
- **Add usage analytics dashboard** showing real-time consumption and remaining credits
- **Implement key rotation notifications** and automated renewal workflows

### 3. Administrative Features
- **Build admin dashboard** for monitoring user key usage across the platform
- **Add bulk key management** operations for administrators
- **Implement usage reporting** and analytics for business insights

### 4. Performance & Security Optimizations
- **Add Redis caching** for frequently accessed key metadata
- **Implement rate limiting** per user key to prevent abuse
- **Add key usage anomaly detection** and automatic suspension

### 5. Integration Testing
- **Create comprehensive test suite** for the provisioning system
- **Add end-to-end tests** for user onboarding and key lifecycle
- **Implement monitoring** and alerting for key provisioning failures

This plan focuses on enhancing the existing robust system rather than re-engineering from scratch.
