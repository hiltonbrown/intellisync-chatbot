feat: Implement AP Risk Rating System with vendor risk scoring

Adds comprehensive risk assessment for Accounts Payable vendors with
automated scoring, visual indicators, and filtering capabilities.

## Features

**Risk Scoring (0-100 points):**
- Missing ABN/Tax Number: +25 points
- Missing Tax Invoice: +20 points
- Unapproved Bill: +30 points
- Blocked Supplier: +60 points

**Risk Levels:**
- Low (0-19): Green badge
- Medium (20-44): Yellow badge
- High (45-69): Orange badge
- Critical (≥70): Red badge

**Bank Change Detection:**
- Separate flag for bank account changes
- AlertTriangle icon with tooltip
- Helps identify potential fraud

## Database Changes

**xero_suppliers table:**
- Added tax_number (ABN/Tax ID)
- Added contact_status (ACTIVE/ARCHIVED/GDPRREQUEST)
- Added bank_account_number
- Added bank_account_name (null due to API limitation)
- Index on contact_status

**xero_bills table:**
- Added invoice_number (tax invoice)
- Added bill_bank_account_number (null due to API limitation)
- Added bill_bank_account_name (null due to API limitation)
- Index on invoice_number

## Code Changes

**New Files:**
- lib/agents/ap/risk-scoring.ts - Core risk calculation logic
- lib/agents/ap/__tests__/risk-scoring.test.ts - Unit tests
- scripts/apply-ap-risk-migration.ts - Migration helper
- docs/AP_RISK_SCORING.md - Feature documentation
- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md - Implementation details

**Modified Files:**
- lib/db/schema.ts - Added risk fields to xero tables
- lib/integrations/xero/actions.ts - Extract risk fields from Xero API
- lib/agents/ap/queries.ts - Calculate risk scores in queries
- components/agents/ap/vendor-table.tsx - Display risk badges & filters
- components/agents/ap/ap-dashboard.tsx - Updated Vendor interface

## UI Enhancements

- Risk badge column with color-coded levels
- Risk level filter tabs (All/Low/Medium/High/Critical)
- Risk score sorting
- Tooltips showing detailed risk factors
- Bank change alert icon with explanation

## Testing

- 20+ unit tests covering all risk scenarios
- Edge case handling (null values, case sensitivity, whitespace)
- Bank account change detection tests
- Risk aggregation tests

## Known Limitations

**Xero API Constraints:**
- Bank account names NOT available (only numbers)
- Bill-specific bank accounts NOT available
- Tax number type not exposed (ABN vs EIN/SSN)

Documented in code comments and user documentation.

## Migration

Applied via: `npx tsx scripts/apply-ap-risk-migration.ts`

Migration: lib/db/migrations/0002_skinny_multiple_man.sql

## Documentation

- Full feature docs in docs/AP_RISK_SCORING.md
- Implementation summary in IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
- Inline code comments explaining limitations
- Visual flow diagram in /tmp/ap_risk_flow.txt

## Verification

All checks pass:
```bash
bash scripts/verify-ap-risk-implementation.sh
```

## Next Steps

1. Sync Xero data to populate new fields
2. User testing of risk filters and sorting
3. Monitor query performance in production
